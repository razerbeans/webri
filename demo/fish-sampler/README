== DESCRIPTION

WebRI is both a dynamic web-based ri-browser which can provided
ri documentation dynamically, by running a webrick server, and
a superalatvie Ruby documentation generator with a variety of
built in templates.

== FEATURES

* WebRI provides Beautiful Templates, enhanced renditions of some of the best designs currently in use.
* Variety of templates built-in, to meet a varitey of tastes and needs.
* Under the hood, a component system allows geneators to be more easily extended.


== LIMITATIONS

Please note that the ri web server and the generation system
were developed separately, and are not well integrated.
For this reason (at the very least) the ri server cannot use
the templates available to the generators. If possible, a future
version will allow this.


== USAGE SYNOPSIS

=== Generate Documentation

WebRI provides a <tt>webri</tt> executable you can use to generate
documentation. The interface is identical to <tt>rdoc</tt>. Use
the -T option to specify a template type.

  $ webri -T redfish README lib/

You can use <tt>rdoc</tt> command if you prefer (though in far
off future versions this may not be the case).

  $ rdoc -T redfish README lib/

WebRI extend RIDoc to recognize the templates that WebRI will handle
and transfers control to appropriate WebRI generator accordingly.

=== Using the Web Server

WebRI can be used as a dynamic ri browser, either for a single project
or for a collection of libraries. Indeed, the WebRI server can be used
to browse the entire installed object system --eveything documented in
your central install locations. To do the later, simply execute
<tt>webri-server</tt> with no arguments and open a webrowser to 
the local port designated (see below).

  $ webr-server

To browse per-project ri documentation, you will first need to locate
the project's ri files, either by locating them in your system installation
or by generating them for a project, which can be done using rdoc, eg.

  $ rdoc --ri --op "doc/ri" lib/

Sometimes a package will include a convenience script for generating these.
Try running 'rake -T', or look for a 'script/' or 'task/' executable that does
the job. Usually the generated documentation is placed in either ri/ or doc/ri/.
I will use doc/ri/ in the following example, adjust your directory as needed.

With ri files loacted you can view them with:

  $ webri-server doc/ri

You will see a Webrick server start up, informing you of the port being used.

  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
  [2008-03-28 12:11:16] INFO  ruby 1.8.6 (2007-06-07) [x86_64-linux]
  [2008-03-28 12:11:21] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=8870 port=8888

In this example we see the port is the default 8888. Simply open your browser and
navigate to:

  http://localhost:8888/

On the left side of the screen you will see a navigation tree, and the right side
contans an infromation panel.

NOTE: Becuase <tt>ri</tt> itself isn't very fast, if you use WebRI against the
entire set of installed Ruby libraries it can take a few seconds to load up.
(Sure wish FastRI turned out for the better.)


== INSTALLATION

Installing via RubyGems is per the usual:

  $ sudo gem install webri
